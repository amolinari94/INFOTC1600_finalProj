# Testing

Now that you've made your webpage, select "run" from the menu bar at the top of your screen, and click "run without debugging".

VSCode will prompt you to choose the browser you want to run your page in, and you can select whichever one you want. 

A window will then pop up with your new webpage.  You've completed your first webpage!
