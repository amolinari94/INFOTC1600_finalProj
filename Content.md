Once your boilerplate is setup, you're ready to add headings and a body to your HTML file. 

First, under your header, copy and paste the following code to add a large heading under your page title: <h1>your heading here</h1>


Next, you can create a body for your webpage.  This is where most of your webpage is written, and where you would spend most of your time working on a webpages initial content layout.
